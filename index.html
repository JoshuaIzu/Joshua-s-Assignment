        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a tech enthusiast who loves turning "What if?" into "Here is how". 
            My journey started with that lightbulb moment realizing code isn't just about syntax, 
            but about solving real problems. 

            My first triumph? Probably successfully pulling data from an API. 
            Sounds trivial, but hey, we all start somewhere! These days, I'm usually knee-deep in web development, 
            AI testing, or building apps that can get me a job, just joking, make life easier. 
            But seriously, I love the adventure of creating something from nothing. 

            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, reading a book, 
            catching up on the latest in AI, or just enjoying a good YouTube video.
